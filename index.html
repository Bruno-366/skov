<p>Skov is a visual programming system based on <a href="http://factorcode.org">Factor</a> and inspired by Lisp.</p>

<p>The project started with the realisation that a two-dimensional visual representation was much better at conveying the structure of a functional program than any one-dimensional textual representation. The program becomes easier to read and to reason about and the probability of making mistakes is greatly reduced. Skov shows the program's structure explicitely and avoids the workarounds found in textual languages.</p>

<div>
  <p class="bloc">This is a vocabulary:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-vocab.png">
  <p class="bloc">It contains words as well as sub-vocabularies.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">This is a word:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-word.png">
  <p class="bloc">It has connectors (inputs at the top, outputs at the bottom).</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">A word with only one output can be a number:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-number.png">
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">or a constant that you have defined:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-constant.png">
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">A word that has only inputs is useful only for its side effects, like writing a file:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-inputs-only.png">
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">A word that has both inputs and outputs is an operation that modifies data:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-word-2.png">
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">This is an input:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-input.png">
</div>
<div>
  <p class="bloc">This is an output:</p>
  <img class="bloc" src="images/screenshot-output.png">
</div>
<p>To define a new word, you simply connect together some inputs, outputs and words, like so:</p>
<div class="centred"><img src="images/screenshot-definition.png"></div>


<p>Reading the program from top to bottom shows data flow. Reading it from bottom to top shows the structure.</p>

<p>You can see the result of a program by clicking the arrow next to a word:</p>
<div class="centred"><img src="images/screenshot-result.png"></div>

<p>Skov has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>works on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows</li>
<li>small footprint (100 MB)</li>
<li>no installation required</li>
<li>self-contained, "small world" system</li>
<li>"batteries included": lots of vocabularies to handle most common tasks</li>
<li>image-based program storage</li>
<li>functional programming</li>
<li>explicit data flow</li>
<li>explicit program structure</li>
<li>easy to use, easy to learn</li>
<li>programs are super-easy to read</li>
<li>probably fantastic for teaching or learning programming</li>
<li>single-key keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>fast and responsive user interface</li>
<li>fast program execution</li>
<li>compiles to machine code</li>
<li>open source, BSD licence</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very young project (started in August 2015) so it has certain limitations at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>no access to the object system from the user interface</li>
<li>all words defined by the user will be stuck in the image, without any way to share them, or move them to a future version of Skov</li>
<li>the documentation is from Factor and hasn't yet been adapted for Skov</li>
</ul>
