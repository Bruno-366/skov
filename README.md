# Skov

Skov is a visual programming system based on Factor and inspired by Lisp.

The project started with the realisation that a two-dimensional visual representation was much better at conveying the structure of a functional program than any one-dimensional textual representation. The program becomes easier to read and to reason about and the probability of making mistakes is greatly reduced. Skov shows the program's structure explicitely and avoids the workarounds found in textual languages.

## Building Skov from Factor

* Download this repository
* Download a Factor binary package from [the Factor website](http://factorcode.org)
* Extract the `factor` directory from the package
* Move or copy all the contents from the Skov repository into the `factor` folder
* Drag and drop the `make-skov.factor` script onto the Factor application

(On Windows, this last step won't work. Instead, you have to start Factor and type `"make-skov.factor" run-file` and press _Enter_)

## Typeface

Skov uses the *Linux Biolinum* typeface. You will need to download it from [here](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=91&L=1) and install it on your system.
