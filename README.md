# Skov

Skov is a visual programming system based on Factor and inspired by Lisp.

## Using Skov as a Factor vocabulary

* Copy the `skov` directory into the `extra` directory of your Factor installation
* In Factor, type `"skov" run`

## Generating a standalone Skov installation

* Download a Factor binary package from [the Factor website](http://www.factorcode.org)
* Extract the `factor` directory from the package
* Copy the `skov` directory from this repository into the `extra` directory
* Drag and drop the `make-skov.factor` script onto the Factor application

## Typeface

Skov uses the *Linux Biolinum* typeface. You will need to download it from [here](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/index.php?id=91&L=1) and install it on your system.
