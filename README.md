# Skov

Skov is a visual programming environment based on [Factor](https://github.com/slavapestov/factor/) and inspired by Lisp.

A functional program can be thought of as a tree (actually a graph) in which functions are connected together on several levels. Commonly used programming languages have to make more or less compromises to represent this tree as a one-dimensional stream of text. Skov uses a visual, two-dimensional representation to display the tree direcly. This makes the program easier to read and to reason about and reduces the risk of making mistakes. Skov lets you see a functional program as it really is.

Skov means *forest* in Danish because Skov contains a lot of trees.

## Building Skov from Factor

* Download this repository
* Download a Factor binary package from [the Factor website](http://factorcode.org)
* Extract the `factor` directory from the package
* Move or copy all the contents from the Skov repository into the `factor` directory
* Drag and drop the `make-skov.factor` script onto the Factor application

## Binary downloads

Binary downloads are available in [Releases](https://github.com/nicolas-p/skov/releases).

## Typeface
